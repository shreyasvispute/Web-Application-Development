          <h2>Childhood🧒</h2>
          <p>
            Hannibal was born into a wealthy aristocratic family in Vilnius,
            Lithuania. He was the descendant of the warlord "Hannibal-the-grim"
            who defeated the

            and in five years built the castle called Castle Lecter.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the winter of 1941 castle was sacked by Nazi Military forces
            which killed Lecter's family including his sister Mischa. Though
            helpless at that time he ran and hid himself with Soviet Forces and
            later on took revenge (you know how! 🥩) on each and every person
            who killed his family.

          <h2>Hannibal and his tastes!😋</h2>
          <p>
            After becoming a psychiatrist, Hannibal quickly became a leading
            figure in Baltimore and indulged himself in extravagant tastes by
            financing from his wealthy clients/patients who he influenced them.
            He later became world-renowned as a brilliant psychiatrist. He also
            cursed psychology as a non-science field criticizing psychology
            department people as "ham radio enthusiasts and other
            personality-deficient buffs".😆
          </p>
          <p>
            Hannibal became a serial killer after he was identified by Mason
            Verger who he nearly killed and was later convicted with at least
            nine murders and attempt to kill three others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hannibal was captured by his "Human" counterpart Will Graham in 1975
            and assisted him in profiling several other murderers.🤠
